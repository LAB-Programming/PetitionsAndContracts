#Petitions and Contracts

---
###Description:
This is a bukkit plugin that allows players to petition server admins and create contracts among themselves. This is specifically made for a specific bukkit server.

---
###Goals:
####Completed:
* Readme
* Command that makes a petition from a written book
* Command that lists outstanding petitions along with info about them
* Command that gives the player a book that contains a petition
* Give petition books lore which gives info about the petition
* Command that allows the player to sign an existing petition that they have in their hand
* Have the lore automatically update when someone signs the petition
* Command that when all of the admins have used it closes a petition (server specific thing)

####Untested:
* Add ability to un-sign petitions

####Short Term (for version 0.0.1):
* A petition with no signatures is removed
* Command that gives additional info on a petition
* Saves petitions to an external file for persistence
* Permissions

####Long Term:
* Have removed petitions able to be "revived"
* Add page for signatures at the end of a petition book
* Have the /petitions list command print use multiple pages if necessary
* All the contract stuff
* Configuration file that gives plugin greater flexibility
* Allow creation of "derivative petitions"
